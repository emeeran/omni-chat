Here are some of the highlights:\n\n1. **Concurrent Rendering**: React 18 introduced concurrent rendering, allowing React to prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time. This feature helps in creating more responsive applications by making it easier to keep the UI responsive even when the app is doing a lot of work.\n\n2. **Automatic Batching**: React 18 enhances the automatic batching of state updates. Previously, React batched state updates only inside React event handlers. With React 18, updates inside promises, setTimeout, native event handlers, or any other event will also be batched automatically.\n\n3. **Transitions**: React 18 introduces a new concept called \"transitions\" to differentiate between urgent and non-urgent updates. Urgent updates, like typing, need to be processed immediately, while non-urgent updates, like animations, can be deferred. This helps in prioritizing work and making the UI more responsive.\n\n4. **Suspense for Data Fetching**: While Suspense was available in earlier versions, React 18 extends its capabilities to data fetching. This allows developers to use Suspense to handle asynchronous operations like data loading, providing a more seamless user experience during data fetching.\n\n5. **React Server Components**: Although not fully released with React 18, React Server Components were introduced to allow developers to build apps that can render both on the server and the client. This helps in improving performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.\n\n6. **New Hooks**: React 18 introduces several new hooks, including `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue`, which help in managing state transitions and deferring updates.\n\n7. **React 18 Strict Mode Enhancements**: The strict mode in React 18 is more powerful, detecting additional issues like unexpected side effects.\n\n8. **Improved SSR and Hydration**: React 18 brings improvements to Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and hydration, making it more efficient and faster. This includes features like selective hydration, which allows parts of the UI to hydrate independently.\n\nThese features collectively aim to improve the performance, responsiveness, and flexibility of React applications, making it easier for developers to create high-quality user experiences.", "created_at": "2025-04-26T19:46:21.883537"}], "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "system_prompt": null, "created_at": "2025-04-26T19:46:10.958131", "updated_at": "2025-04-26T19:46:21.883551"}
