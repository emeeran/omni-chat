It is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the brain that plays a critical role in regulating movement. This leads to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms.\n\n### Key Features\n\n#### Motor Symptoms\n1. **Tremor**: Often the most recognizable symptom, typically presenting as a resting tremor in the hands or fingers.\n2. **Bradykinesia**: Slowness of movement, which can make simple tasks difficult and time-consuming.\n3. **Rigidity**: Increased muscle stiffness that can occur in the limbs and trunk, often leading to a decreased range of motion.\n4. **Postural Instability**: Impaired balance and coordination, which can increase the risk of falls.\n\n#### Non-Motor Symptoms\n1. **Cognitive Changes**: Difficulties with memory, attention, and problem-solving can occur, with some patients developing Parkinson's disease dementia.\n2. **Mood Disorders**: Depression and anxiety are common among individuals with Parkinson's disease.\n3. **Sleep Disturbances**: Patients may experience insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder, or excessive daytime sleepiness.\n4. **Autonomic Dysfunction**: This can include constipation, urinary incontinence, and orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing up).\n5. **Sensory Symptoms**: These can include a diminished sense of smell (hyposmia) and pain.\n\n### Causes and Risk Factors\nThe exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but it likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include age (most people are diagnosed over 60), family history, sex (males are more commonly affected), and exposure to certain toxins.\n\n### Diagnosis\nDiagnosis is primarily clinical, based on medical history and neurological examination. There are no definitive laboratory tests for Parkinson's disease, although imaging tests like MRI or DaTscan may be used to rule out other conditions.\n\n### Treatment\nWhile there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, several treatments can help manage symptoms:\n1. **Medications**: These often include levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, and others to manage symptoms.\n2. **Surgical Options**: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an option for patients with advanced symptoms not adequately controlled by medication.\n3. **Lifestyle and Supportive Therapies**: Regular physical exercise, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and nutritional guidance can be beneficial.\n\n### Research and Outlook\nResearch is ongoing to better understand the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, develop new treatments, and ultimately find a cure. Advances in genetics, neuroimaging, and neuroprotection offer hope for future breakthroughs.", "created_at": "2025-04-26T11:20:06.431411"}], "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "system_prompt": null, "created_at": "2025-04-26T11:19:59.068821", "updated_at": "2025-04-26T11:20:06.431434", "saved": false}
