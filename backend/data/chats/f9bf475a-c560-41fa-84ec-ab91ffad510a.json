Here are the main highlights:\n\n1. **Concurrent Rendering**: This is the most significant update in React 18. It allows React to prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time. This helps in improving the responsiveness of applications by enabling React to interrupt rendering when more important updates like user interactions come in.\n\n2. **Automatic Batching**: Previously, React only batched updates inside event handlers. React 18 expands this to also include all updates \u2014 even those inside promises, setTimeouts, and other event handlers. This results in fewer renders and improved performance.\n\n3. **Transition API**: This is a new API that allows developers to mark some updates as non-urgent. This helps in distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent updates, allowing React to prioritize rendering tasks appropriately. It is particularly useful for creating smoother UI transitions.\n\n4. **Suspense Improvements**: React 18 introduces enhancements to Suspense functionality, allowing it to work with concurrent rendering. This makes it easier to build applications that can gracefully handle asynchronous data fetching and loading states.\n\n5. **startTransition API**: This new API is used to mark updates as transitions, allowing React to interrupt these updates if more urgent updates, such as user interactions, come in.\n\n6. **New Hooks**: React 18 introduces several new hooks, including `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, and `useId`, which help developers manage state transitions, deferred values, and unique IDs for server-rendered content.\n\n7. **Improved Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: React 18 improves SSR performance with features like streaming server rendering, which allows parts of the UI to be sent to the client as they are ready, rather than waiting for the entire page to be ready.\n\n8. **React Server Components**: Though still experimental, React Server Components are designed to allow developers to build components that can be rendered on the server, which can help reduce client-side JavaScript bundle sizes and improve app performance.\n\nThese features collectively aim to make React applications more efficient, performant, and easier to build, especially for complex, interactive UIs.", "created_at": "2025-04-26T19:44:01.602292"}], "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "system_prompt": null, "created_at": "2025-04-26T19:43:54.487698", "updated_at": "2025-04-26T19:44:01.602298"}
